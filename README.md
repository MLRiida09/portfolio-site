# 🚀 Mini Project: Sidebar Website with Dark Mode

This is a small front-end project that includes a responsive sidebar layout, a dark mode toggle, and a placeholder "Coming Soon" section for future expansion.

> The concept was inspired by an AI suggestion, but all the implementation and coding was done by me as part of my learning journey.
